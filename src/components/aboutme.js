          <p>
            I'm Aryan Kharva, a Computer Science student at UNC Charlotte with a concentration in Web/Mobile Development & Software Engineering. My love for building started as a kid with Lego sets, Minecraft worlds, and woodworking â€” anything that let me design and problem-solve creatively. That passion turned into purpose when I started taking computer science classes in high school, thanks to the inspiration of my teacher, Dr. Alex Kaulfuss.
          </p>
          <p>
            I explored every corner of the field â€” from cybersecurity and data science to cloud computing and AI â€” because I believe in trying before judging. That led me to discover what I truly enjoy: building smart, beautiful tools with web technologies and generative AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently doing undergraduate research working on a RAG model using Llama 2 and OpenAI APIs. Iâ€™m a three-time Chancellorâ€™s List recipient (Spring 2024, Fall 2024, and Spring 2025) and constantly looking for ways to grow as a developer and a person.

        <h2 className="personal-title">Beyond the Code</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m more than just my resume. I still build LEGO sets â€” especially Star Wars ones â€” and Iâ€™ll defend The Clone Wars as peak Star Wars to anyone who asks. Star Wars has always inspired my creativity and love of storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love trying new foods, discovering underrated restaurants, and spending quality time with family and friends. Whether itâ€™s late-night boba runs, spontaneous road trips, or backyard bonfires â€” these moments fuel me as much as my projects do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring that same spirit into my work: curious, thoughtful, and driven to build things that bring joy, clarity, or just a touch of wow.
        </p>
