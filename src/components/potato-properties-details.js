          <h2>More About This Project</h2>
          <p>
            This was a collaborative team project I worked on with five classmates as part of our software engineering coursework. I contributed heavily on both the frontend and backend â€” developing routes, building EJS templates, and working on session logic and form handling.
          </p>

          <h3>Development Process</h3>
          <p>
            We planned the entire project using a shared Trello Kanban board and regularly split up tasks in sprints. From the database models to route handlers, we applied full-stack principles using Express, MongoDB, and modular EJS components.
          </p>

          <p>
            My contributions included form validation middleware, property application flow, dashboard views, and helping unify the visual styling across the app using consistent CSS layouts.
          </p>

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <p>
            This project helped me grow as both a developer and a teammate. I learned how to contribute to a shared codebase effectively, resolve merge conflicts, and translate real-world requirements into working code under deadlines.
