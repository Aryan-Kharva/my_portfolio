          <h2>More About This Project</h2>
          <p>
            This was a collaborative effort between team members, with responsibilities split across features like search, compare, and saved listings. I led the initial design process and frontend structure.
          </p>
<br></br>
          <h3>Design Process</h3>
          <p>
            I kicked off our team project by drafting the layout and structure in Figma. This helped align our group on what pages we needed, how the flow should work, and how to visually present search results, comparisons, and saved properties. It acted as the blueprint before we started coding together.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <ul className="project-bullets">
            <li>Compare multiple properties side-by-side with interactive toggling</li>
            <li>Property search with filtering by price, number of rooms, and type</li>
            <li>Favorites/saved properties with persistent local state</li>
            <li>Modular design using EJS templates and custom backend logic</li>
            <li>Fully responsive layout built with CSS Grid and Flexbox</li>
            <li>Team collaboration using Git for version control and component-based division of work</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Coordinating multiple contributors on a team project came with its own set of challenges. Merging code, organizing Git branches, and keeping consistent styling across pages was a learning experience. On the technical side, implementing the comparison logic and ensuring clean UI updates without overlap took some trial and error.
          </p>
<br></br>
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Potato Properties taught me how to work in a collaborative development environment. I got hands-on experience turning a Figma mockup into a working site, while also improving my skills in responsive design, modular coding, and conflict resolution in version control. It gave me confidence to contribute both visually and technically to team-based projects.
